# A set of projects I did to refresh my grasp on Python after a long break from it.

Most of these are my takes on projects from Angela Yu's 100 days of Python course. I'll categorise them according to difficulty.

Note: My categorisation is based on my personal experience, for example: `Love Score` was easy for me due to my experience with loops and using the nifty `in` operator. However when it was done in the course - none of these were introduced so it might be difficult for someone else, always remember - this is objective and just because something is easy for me doesn't mean it will be easy for someone else.

The aim is to keep these basic programs as sophisticated as possible by adding things ranging from extra features to keeping these safe by checking for types and valid inputs.
