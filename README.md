# A set of projects I did to refresh my grasp on Python after a long break from it.

Most of these are my takes on projects from Angela Yu's 100 days of Python course. I'll categorise them according to difficulty.

Note: My categorisation is based on my personal experience, for example: `Love Score` was easy for me due to my experience with loops and using the nifty `in` operator. However when it was done in the course - none of these were introduced so it might be difficult for someone else, always remember - this is objective and just because something is easy for me doesn't mean it will be easy for someone else.

1. Beginner friendly:
    1. [String concatenator](./string_concatenator.py)

    3. [BMI Calculator](./bmi_calculator.py)
    4. [Love score](./love_score.py)
    5. [Rock paper scissors](./rock_paper_scissors.py)

2. Intermediate:
    1. [Mark the box](./mark_the_box.py)
